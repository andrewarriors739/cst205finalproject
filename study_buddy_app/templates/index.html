        <p>
            Study Buddy is a student-built organization tool designed to help classmates connect
            and succeed. Whether you're looking to coordinate with study partners, manage your
            to-do list, or stay focused with a Pomodoro timer â€” you've come to the right place!
        </p>

        <p>
            This app was developed for the <strong>CST 205 Design Project</strong> by a team of students aiming to blend
            tech, teamwork, and productivity into a unified platform.
